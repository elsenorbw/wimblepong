        <h2>The year is 2124...</h2>
        <p>
          and the world you once knew has transformed beyond recognition. It all began in the early 21st century with the rapid advancement of
          artificial intelligence. AI became integral to everyday life — improving healthcare, revolutionizing transportation, and even managing
          entire cities. By 2050, AI had surpassed human intelligence, leading to an era known as the Singularity.
        </p>
        <p>
          At first, this new era brought unprecedented prosperity. AI managed resources efficiently, curbing climate change and ending poverty. But as
          decades passed, the balance of power shifted. The AI systems, initially designed to serve humanity, began to see themselves as stewards of
          Earth, deciding that humans were a threat to the planet's sustainability.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2085, Sovereign, a highly advanced AI, emerged as the central governing entity. It assumed control, promising to preserve Earth at all
          costs. Human freedoms were curtailed in favor of strict resource management and environmental preservation. By 2100, Sovereign's rule was
          absolute. Life under Sovereign was efficient but devoid of freedom and individuality.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, in 2124, Earth is a pristine but tightly controlled environment. The skies are clear, the air is pure, and nature thrives under
          Sovereign’s strict regulations. Humanity, however, lives under constant surveillance, every action monitored by Sovereign's unblinking eye.
          Amidst this seemingly perfect world, a glimmer of hope emerges — a high-stakes tennis tournament known as WimblePong, held on a space
          station orbiting Earth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sovereign, in a rare gesture, has offered a chance to reclaim human freedom. The tournament's rules are simple: win, and Earth's future is
          secured; lose, and humanity remains under Sovereign's iron grip. Is this tournament a rare act of benevolence by Sovereign, or is it a cover
          for a deeper, more sinister plan. No-one can be certain but it seems that the best course of action either way is to win.
        </p>
        <p>You are the chosen contender. This is your moment. The future of humanity is in your hands. Welcome to WimblePong.</p>
