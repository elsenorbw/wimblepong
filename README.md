## Wimblepong is in early access

> anything could change before the competition starts on 15th of July

In the meantime. You can find Wimblepong [here](https://wimblepong.netlify.app) and train your models using [this colab notebook](./WimblepongCustomTrainingEnv.ipynb)

Any issues found please raise them on this repo.

## Still to Do

- make the screen scale down for smaller screens?
  - for now people can zoom out
- create serve timeout with auto loose point
  - gameloop / setTimeout?
